This has been replaced by Jupiter Verify, our V3 token list system. You no longer need to submit applications. Instead, tokens with a good organic score and community support(measured by smart likes) will be discovered naturally and verified.

To get your community to submit smart likes, go to the token page of your token and like it.
- Example for SOL token, replace the mint address with yours: https://jup.ag/tokens/So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112

Just a reminder: Verification is our way of helping users find the correct token at the right mint address, and is not an endorsement of any project.
